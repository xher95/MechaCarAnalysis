## Part 1

### Variables/Coefficients That Provided a Non-random Amount of Variance to the MPG Values
The 4 variables that provided non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset are vehicle length, vehicle weight, spoiler angle, and ground clearance. 
The data we have from these 4 variables are continuous. 
I've excluded AWD data as it is either true or false and categorical, therefore it is not suited for linear regression analysis.

### Zero?
The slop of the linear model is not zero because the p-value is 2.277x10-11, which is much smaller than a typical assumed significance level of 0.05%.
Therefore, we can state that there is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis, which means that the slope of our linear model is not zero.

### MechaCar Prototypes Prediction Effective?
The model is fairly accurate with a R value or confidence level of 70% accuracy.
This means in the future prediction, there's about a 70% chance that our prediction will be correct.
We can say that factors in length, and ground clearance for MechaCar prototype models have a greater impact to MPG. 
MechaCar Vehicles' spoiler angle and weight in our prototype data reveals these 2 factors do not correlate to MPG.

## Part 2
### Coil Summary and T-Test

By producing a summary table of mean, median, variance, and standard deviation, we can easily see and compare the manufacturing lots. 
While the mean and median of the 3 lots were very similar to within 1 or 2 PSI, the variance and standard deviation tells a different story. 
Manufacturing lot 1 has a much more uniform production result compared to lot 3, which has the highest range of variance and standard deviation. 
MechaCar's spec dictates that the variance can not exceed 100 PSI, so lot 3 having a 220 PSI variance fails the test.
While Lot 1 and lot 2 are within acceptable ranges, 1.15 and 10.1 PSI variance respectively.

By generating a sampling data, and comparing it to the population using t-test, we can see if our sample data is statistically similar or not.
After several tries, we can see that our sample data has a high p value in general much higher than .05 commonly accepted.
Therefore, our null hypothesis is accepted as our sample data mean PSI is similar to the population mean PSI of 1500.

## Part 3
### Design your own study
Among many types of things to consider when car shopping, consumers may consider repair costs.
If we design a study to show lower repair costs for MechaCar compared to our competitors, it may render a boost in customer confidence.

### Questions to Consider
Most cars average about 100,000 miles before being considered for repairs.
What will the cost rate be for repairs by then?

What about extra repairs needed before the mileage checkpoint?
